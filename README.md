# Prism Nexus

**Split value. Route intent. Recombine outcomes.**

Prism Nexus is an experimental smart contract framework that treats incoming value flows as "rays of light" entering a prism — they can be split, routed across multiple paths, and eventually recombined with full transparency and trust minimization.

## Project Description

Prism Nexus reimagines how value and intent move through the blockchain ecosystem. Instead of simple A→B transfers, users deposit value along with an on-chain intent hash. The prism (this contract) can then split that value across multiple destinations (e.g., DeFi protocols, bridges, charities, staking contracts) and later recombine outputs when needed.

Think of it as programmable, multi-hop, intent-centric value routing — a foundational layer for the intent economy.

## Project Vision

To become the universal refraction layer for on-chain value: any token or NFT entering the Prism can be automatically split, transformed, and routed according to user-defined or community-governed intents, enabling complex financial strategies with a single transaction.

## Key Features

- **Ray Entry**: Every deposit creates an immutable "Ray" with sender, amount, and intent hash.
- **Split & Route**: Owner (or future automated solvers/relayers) can disperse funds across any number of addresses.
- **Recombine**: Multiple rays can be recombined and sent to a final recipient (foundation for cross-chain & multi-input strategies).
- Fully auditable on-chain events.
- Extensible design for future ERC20/NFT support and solver competition.

## Future Scope

- Full ERC20 & ERC721 support
- Intent solver marketplace (anyone can fulfill intents for a fee)
- Cross-chain refraction via LayerZero / CCIP
- Integration with account abstraction (EIP-4337) for gasless entry
- Governance module for community-defined routing rules
- Prism SDK for dApps to easily integrate intent-centric flows
